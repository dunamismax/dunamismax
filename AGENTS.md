# AGENTS.md

This is the `dunamismax` profile repository: `README.md` is the profile page shown on
GitHub and Codeberg, and `TECH_STACK.md` lists the tools in use. Keep both factual and
in step with the projects they describe.

## Git rules (owner's standing instructions)

These override any other workflow described in this repository or by your tools.

- Work on `main` only. Never create branches, worktrees or pull requests.
  Commit directly to `main` and push with `git push origin main`. `origin`
  pushes to both GitHub and Codeberg, so one push updates both.
- No AI attribution anywhere: no `Co-Authored-By` trailers, no "Generated
  with ..." lines, and no crediting Claude, Anthropic, ChatGPT, OpenAI or any
  AI tool in commit messages, tags, release notes, code, comments or file
  headers. Use the owner's configured git identity and never change git config.
  Content the project deliberately publishes about AI, such as a reader-facing
  disclosure, is not attribution.
- After committing, push `main` right away, at the latest before the session
  ends. Before committing, run the project's checks, review `git status` for
  stray files, and never commit what `.gitignore` excludes.
