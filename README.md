## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Git (optional, only needed for local edits)
- A GitHub account (for publishing profile updates)

### Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunamismax/dunamismax.git
cd dunamismax
```

Expected result:

- You can read and edit `README.md` locally.
- Pushing changes to the default branch updates the GitHub profile page.

## Features

- Profile summary focused on current engineering priorities.
- Technology snapshot spanning frontend, backend, infrastructure, and DX.
- Direct links to active public projects.
- Single-file maintenance model (`README.md`) for quick iteration.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Content | Markdown | Profile presentation and structure |
| Hosting | GitHub profile repository | Public profile rendering |
| Collaboration | Git | Version history and updates |

## Project Structure

```sh

Command verification notes for this README rewrite:

- Verified in this environment: `git -C /home/sawyer/github/dunamismax status --short`.
- Not executed in this rewrite: profile publish flow (`git commit` / `git push`).

## Deployment and Operations

This repository has no application runtime. Deployment is equivalent to pushing markdown updates to the default branch.

## Security and Reliability Notes

- No runtime secrets or service credentials should be stored in this repository.
- Keep external project links current to avoid stale or broken profile references.
