Hello! Thanks for stopping by.

I'm an IT Director with over a decade of experience, but my true passion is the craft of software developmentâ€”especially with Go. I'm driven by its power to create incredibly fast, single-binary applications that are a joy to deploy and maintain.

This journey led me to create **The Go-Pragmatic Stack**, my official architecture for building best-in-class, modern web applications. It's a complete, opinionated blueprint for creating highly performant and maintainable software. It pairs a powerful Go backend with a modern, server-centric frontend toolchain, providing a structured and scalable environment without unnecessary complexity.

I share my work and reference implementations freely, hoping to help others build better, faster software. If my projects have helped you out, I'd be incredibly grateful if you'd consider supporting my work with a coffee.

It makes a huge difference!

### My Go Toolkit

My toolkit is a reflection of the Go-Pragmatic stack: focused on performance, simplicity, and a superior developer experience with Go at the core.

<summary><h3>The Go-Pragmatic Stack (Click to Expand)</h3></summary>

This stack represents a complete, best-in-class architecture for building secure, observable, and maintainable web applications. It is composed of a powerful Go backend and a modern, server-centric frontend toolchain. The stack prioritizes simplicity, rapid development, and zero-dependency deployment by favoring Go's native capabilities and lightweight, embedded tools.

---

### **Frontend**

The frontend architecture uses a modern build system and a server-centric interactivity model to deliver a fast, responsive, and maintainable user experience with minimal client-side complexity.

- [**esbuild**](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/) & [**PostCSS**](https://postcss.org/docs/postcss-cli)
  - **Role:** Asset Pipeline.
  - **Description:** A high-speed asset pipeline using esbuild for bundling and PostCSS for processing Tailwind CSS. This ensures a highly optimized production output while maintaining a rapid development feedback loop.
- [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
  - **Role:** Utility-First CSS Framework.
  - **Description:** A highly-customizable, utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development directly within the HTML markup.
- [**HTMX**](https://htmx.org/docs/) & [**Alpine.js**](https://alpinejs.dev/start-here)
  - **Role:** Server-Centric & Client-Side Interactivity.
  - **Description:** HTMX provides powerful AJAX and dynamic content updates directly from HTML attributes, while Alpine.js serves as the perfect lightweight companion for small client-side interactions like dropdowns and modals.

---

### **Backend**

A lean, performant, and maintainable backend service architected for rapid development and long-term stability.

- [**Go**](https://go.dev/doc/)
  - **Role:** Backend Language.
  - **Description:** A statically typed, compiled language renowned for its performance, concurrency, and simplicity. Its ability to compile to a single binary simplifies deployment.
- [**Gin**](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/)
  - **Role:** High-Performance Web Framework.
  - **Description:** A popular and fast HTTP web framework for Go, offering a rich feature set including routing, middleware, and validation that accelerates API development.
- [**`koanf`**](https://github.com/knadh/koanf) & [**`log/slog`**](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog)
  - **Role:** Configuration & Logging.
  - **Description:** `koanf` provides a clean API for reading configuration from files and environment variables, while `slog` produces consistent, machine-readable logs essential for monitoring and debugging.

---

### **Database & Caching**

A zero-dependency, in-process data layer that maximizes simplicity and speed for a wide range of applications.

- [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html)
  - **Role:** Embedded Relational Database.
  - **Description:** A self-contained, serverless SQL database engine that runs in-process with the application, eliminating operational overhead.
- [**`sqlc`**](https://docs.sqlc.dev/)
  - **Role:** Type-Safe SQL to Go Code Generation.
  - **Description:** A tool that generates fully type-safe, idiomatic Go code from raw SQL queries, preventing data-related bugs at compile time.
- [**`golang-migrate/migrate`**](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/blob/master/MIGRATIONS.md)
  - **Role:** Database Schema Migrations.
  - **Description:** A robust tool for managing and applying versioned SQL schema migrations.
- [**`go-cache`**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/patrickmn/go-cache)
  - **Role:** In-Process Caching.
  - **Description:** A simple, thread-safe in-memory key-value store with expiration times for extremely fast caching without external dependencies.

---

### **Development & Deployment**

A professional and minimalist toolchain for a smooth developer workflow and consistent, single-binary builds.

- [**Mage**](https://magefile.org/)
  - **Role:** Go-Native Task Runner / Build System.
  - **Description:** A build tool that allows you to write build scripts and tasks in plain Go, providing a type-safe and idiomatic way to orchestrate all development workflows.
- [**Air**](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air)
  - **Role:** Live Reloading.
  - **Description:** A development utility that watches for file changes and automatically recompiles and restarts the server.
- [**Caddy**](https://caddyserver.com/docs/)
  - **Role:** Web Server & Reverse Proxy.
  - **Description:** A modern web server with automatic HTTPS. It serves static frontend assets and acts as a secure reverse proxy for the Go application.

### My Current Focus: The Go-Pragmatic Reference Implementation

My **Go-Pragmatic** monorepo serves as the official reference implementation for **The Go-Pragmatic Stack**. It is the central hub where I put my architectural philosophy into practice, creating a living testament to the power and elegance of this approach.
