Hello! Thanks for stopping by.

I'm an IT Director with over a decade of experience, but my true passion is the craft of software developmentâ€”especially with Go. I'm driven by its power to create incredibly fast, single-binary applications that are a joy to deploy and maintain.

This journey led me to create **The Go-Pragmatic Stack**, my official architecture for building best-in-class, modern web applications. It's a complete, opinionated blueprint for creating highly performant and maintainable software. It pairs a powerful Go backend with a modern, server-centric frontend toolchain, providing a structured and scalable environment without unnecessary complexity.

I share my work and reference implementations freely, hoping to help others build better, faster software. If my projects have helped you out, I'd be incredibly grateful if you'd consider supporting my work with a coffee.

It makes a huge difference!

### My Go Toolkit

My toolkit is a reflection of the Go-Pragmatic stack: focused on performance, simplicity, and a superior developer experience with Go at the core.

<summary><h3>The Go-Pragmatic Stack (Click to Expand)</h3></summary>

This stack represents a complete, best-in-class architecture for building secure, observable, and maintainable web applications. It is composed of a powerful Go backend and a modern, server-centric frontend toolchain. The stack prioritizes simplicity, rapid development, and zero-dependency deployment by favoring Go's native capabilities and lightweight, embedded tools.

### **Frontend**

The frontend architecture uses a modern build system and a server-centric interactivity model to deliver a fast, responsive, and maintainable user experience with minimal client-side complexity.

- [**esbuild**](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/)
  - **Role:** Asset Bundler & Minifier.
  - **Description:** An extremely fast JavaScript and CSS bundler written in Go. It processes frontend assets, handles module bundling, and performs minification, ensuring a highly optimized production output while maintaining a rapid development feedback loop.
- [**PostCSS**](https://postcss.org/docs/postcss-cli)
  - **Role:** CSS Processor.
  - **Description:** A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. It is essential for processing the Tailwind CSS framework, running as part of the build step to compile utility classes and custom directives into a standard, browser-ready stylesheet.
- [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
  - **Role:** Utility-First CSS Framework.
  - **Description:** A highly-customizable, utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development directly within the HTML markup. It promotes design consistency and produces a minimal CSS file for production.
- [**HTMX**](https://htmx.org/docs/)
  - **Role:** Server-Centric Interactivity.
  - **Description:** A powerful library that enables modern browser features like AJAX and dynamic content updates directly from HTML attributes. It allows the backend to deliver UI fragments over the wire, providing rich user experiences without complex client-side JavaScript.
- [**Go `html/template`**](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template)
  - **Role:** Secure HTML Templating.
  - **Description:** The official Go standard library for creating HTML templates. It provides secure, context-aware automatic escaping to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, making it a robust and idiomatic choice for server-side rendering of HTML pages and HTMX partials.
- [**Alpine.js**](https://alpinejs.dev/start-here)
  - **Role:** Lightweight Client-Side Interactivity.
  - **Description:** A rugged, minimal framework for composing JavaScript behavior directly in your HTML markup. It serves as the perfect lightweight companion to HTMX for handling small client-side interactions like dropdowns, modals, and toggles, without requiring a heavy client-side framework.

---

### **Backend**

A lean, performant, and maintainable backend service architected for rapid development and long-term stability.

- [**Go**](https://go.dev/doc/)
  - **Role:** Backend Language.
  - **Description:** A statically typed, compiled language renowned for its performance, concurrency, and simplicity. Its ability to compile to a single binary simplifies deployment.
- [**Gin**](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/)
  - **Role:** High-Performance Web Framework.
  - **Description:** A popular and fast HTTP web framework for Go, offering a rich feature set including routing, middleware, and JSON validation, which helps accelerate API development.
- [**`go-playground/validator`**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-playground/validator/v10)
  - **Role:** Struct Validation.
  - **Description:** The de-facto standard for data validation using struct tags. It ensures data integrity by validating incoming request data at the application's edge.
- [**`koanf`**](https://github.com/knadh/koanf)
  - **Role:** Lightweight & Flexible Configuration.
  - **Description:** A minimal and modular configuration management library. It provides a clean API for reading configuration from various sources like files and environment variables with a small dependency footprint, making it a simple and maintainable choice.
- [**`log/slog`**](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog)
  - **Role:** Structured Logging.
  - **Description:** The official structured logging library in the Go standard library. It produces consistent, machine-readable logs essential for effective monitoring and debugging.

---

### **Database & Caching**

A zero-dependency, in-process data layer that maximizes simplicity and speed for a wide range of applications.

- [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html)
  - **Role:** Embedded Relational Database.
  - **Description:** A self-contained, serverless, full-featured SQL database engine that runs in-process with the application. It reads and writes to a single file, eliminating operational overhead and making it perfect for local development, testing, and many production workloads.
- [**`sqlc`**](https://docs.sqlc.dev/)
  - **Role:** Type-Safe SQL to Go Code Generation.
