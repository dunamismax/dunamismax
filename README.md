With over a decade of IT experience, I specialize in building fast, maintainable, single-binary applications with Go. To streamline modern web development, I created **[go-scaffold](https://github.com/dunamismax/go-scaffold)**â€”an opinionated, production-ready blueprint designed to get you up and running instantly.

This repository is the culmination of my philosophy: a ready-to-clone template that pairs a high-performance Go backend with a responsive, server-centric frontend. It's built on **The Go-Pragmatic Stack** and is designed for developers who value simplicity, performance, and an elegant workflow.

### My Featured Project: `go-scaffold`

My **[go-scaffold](https://github.com/dunamismax/go-scaffold)** repository is a living project that serves as a powerful, real-world template for building robust web applications. It's more than just a collection of tools; it's a complete development ecosystem.

### The Ultimate Workflow: The `Magefile`

One of the standout features of the `go-scaffold` template is its **`magefile.go`**. This isn't just a build script; it's a complete, Go-native task runner that orchestrates the entire development lifecycle. It provides a seamless, cross-platform experience without ever leaving the Go ecosystem.

**Why is it so great?**

- **Simplicity:** Manage complex workflows with simple commands like `mage dev` or `mage check`.
- **Consistency:** Ensures every developer on a project uses the exact same commands for building, testing, and linting.
- **Extensibility:** It's written in pure Go, making it easy to customize and extend for any project-specific needs.

With a single command, you can spin up a live-reloading development environment, run a comprehensive suite of tests and linters, build production-ready binaries, and manage database migrations. It's designed to make you productive from the very first minute.

### My Go Toolkit

My toolkit is a reflection of the Go-Pragmatic stack, which powers `go-scaffold`: focused on performance, simplicity, and a superior developer experience with Go at the core.

<summary><h3>The go-scaffold Stack (Click to Expand)</h3></summary>

This stack represents a complete, best-in-class architecture for building secure, observable, and maintainable web applications. It is composed of a powerful Go backend and a modern, server-centric frontend toolchain. The stack prioritizes simplicity, rapid development, and zero-dependency deployment by favoring Go's native capabilities and lightweight, embedded tools.
