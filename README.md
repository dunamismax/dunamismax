# Forge Realm TCG - Open Source Trading Card Game

**Bringing the golden age of Magic back to life** - I'm the creator of Forge Realm TCG, a fully open-source trading card game inspired by the classic design philosophy and dark fantasy aesthetic of vintage Magic: The Gathering. Built with transparent development, community governance, and unrestricted access, we're preserving the original spirit of strategic card play where depth, creativity, and imagination reign supreme.
