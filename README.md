# Magic at Its Best

**Creator of Ideal Magic** - It's the Magic you remember at its best—sharp, interactive, and endlessly replayable—refined until every decision feels clean in the hand and vivid on the table. The rules step out of the way. The drama stays.

## **The Ultimate Magic Curation**

You start at twenty life with the London Mulligan, and the game meets you halfway: scry, surveil, cycling, and clues smooth rough draws without erasing variance. Lands remain the heartbeat—one a turn, tap for color, plan your curve—and the color pie still shapes every story you tell.

**Ward, not hexproof** is the default shield: a small toll that invites real counterplay rather than shutting it off. Play is board-first and paper-friendly—every moving part lives where you can see it.

## **The Beloved Glue Suite**

**Featured mechanics that make choices sing:**

- **Kicker** - Scale spells to the moment
